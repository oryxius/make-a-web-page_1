        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<p>HTML is what glues everything on the web together by using <em>hyperlinks</em>. It was invented in 1990s and has over 30 billion pages. It contains all kinds of files: plain text, HTML, images, videos and audio. The major pieces of the web are the user, the computer (which has a browser), the Internet, and the Server. The web works as follows: a user types the URL of a website into a browser, the computer then sends an HTTP request to a server, then the server finds the appropriate HTML documents and sends it back to the computer which then reads it and displays it in its browser to the user.</p>

			<h3>HTML Markup</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<p>The markup itself is written using tags. Opening tags and closing tags with content in between form HTML elements. Tags include the &lt;b> (bold) tag, &lt;em> (italic), &lt;br> (line break), etc. Tags could also include attributes such as the href attribute inclosed in the “anchor” tag &lt;a href=”URL”>.</p>

			<h3>Human vs. Computer</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<p>Computers are seen as “stupid” because they are too literal: code must be very accurate for them to be able to read it. Small errors in instructions, which a human being normally ignores, can cause unforetold consequences.</p>

			<h3>Inline vs Block</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<p>The &lt;br> tag represents “inline” formatting where the markup signifies end of the a line, while the &lt;p> (paragraph) tag represents the “block” formatting, where the markup signifies an invisible box around the text.</p>

	  	  <h3>Overview</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">       
<p>The Web we see is made mainly from three components: HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Java script.</p>

	  	  <h3>How a Website Works</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<P>It is useful to have a conceptual understanding of how a website works. If HTML is the walls in a house, CSS is the styles in that house, and the Java script is the interactive components in the house. In other words, HTML controls the "structure" of a web page whereas CSS controls how the page looks.</P>

	  	  <h3>Observing a Webpage Structure</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<P>We could observe a webpage’s structure using developer tools in Chrome. Doing that we could observe that not all elements are visible, elements are presented visually as colored rectangles on the page, and if you read deep enough you will be able to read all text as is on the page.</P>

	  	  <h3>How Webpages Are Structured</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<P>Pages are structured like trees with parent elements having children elements. In programming this tree-like structure is called Document Object Model (DOM). The browser turns HTML elements into a DOM structure. HTML has syntax and rules. It uses opening and closing tags to create elements. Each tag has a name and type that defines its nature (paragraph, image, block, etc.). Each tag can also have attributes with values. So HTML defines the structure and content of the page. To define the style, we use CSS which uses specific syntax and rules to define how elements look on the page. HTML would thus provide the browser with information on what style to use and where to get it.</P>

	  	  <h3>Squares! Squares!</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<P>Everything on a webpage is really a square. Using squares makes it easier to present HTML elements. We point out boxes by using the &lt;div> tag, and we mark them out by giving them a class attribute, which act like “labels on boxes”.</P>

	  	  <h3>What's in a Name?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and the most important part of this name is the word “Cascading”. This is because in CSS there is a cascading effect in terms of style from the parent elements to any child elements they may have, but with one caveat: The most specific rule down this cascade takes precedence. CSS is very efficient because it helps avoid repetition.</p>

	  	  <h3>Importance of Order in CSS</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<p>Order also matters in CSS. The following is the order from less to most important: The default style of a browser, then the stylesheet in a separate file, then the stylesheet inside HTML, then the inline style in an element.</p>

	  	  <h3>Conncecting HTML to CSS</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<p>A link element can be added within the head element in the HTML element to link the HTML document to a CSS stylesheet. Another way to create style in an HTML document is by inserting a style element in the head itself. Still, a third not recommended method is to write the style inline within the HTML elements as style attributes. CSS works by applying a set of style rules contained in curly braces to a selector or a selector class.</p>

	  	  <h3>Benefits of CSS</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<p>One of the most important ideas in computer programming is not to repeat unnecessary actions. CSS helps programmers avoid repetition: helping them understand the code better, to write it more efficiently, and to communicate in a style that is understood by all. Avoiding repetition ultimately saves both effort and money.</p>

	  	  <h3>HTML and Boxes</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-detail">
<p>HTML elements are really boxes and each box has a content area, a padding, a border, and a margin. For best sizing results, it is better to use percentages rather than pixels, and then set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element. One also need to be aware that different browsers behave slightly differently causing some display issues. Divs are represented by boxes that take up the entire width of a page, so it is necessary to add the rule “display: flex;” to CSS to let divs appear next to each other.</p>
